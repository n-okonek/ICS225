              <h1>Join the Crew Page Design Concepts</h1>
              <h2>Main Concepts:</h2>
              <p>This page is intended for people to request a show. I realize now after looking at the page, that I did not include an email address field for the crew to get back to the applicant.</p>
              <h2>Element Concepts:</h2>
              <p>In the lower left corner are the breadcrumb links. Currently these are hardcoded to be shown in their respective heirarchy. I would eventually like to be able to make that dynamic based on the referrer URL from the DOM. With that being said, I would also like to see the layer that the breadcrumbs reside in be shown if they are coming from a page that is internal, but external URL referrers would not pop the breadcrumbs.</p>
              <p>I put a recruiting poster over the flag, to give a sparse page some more flare. However, I think this would be a prime example of where I should not allow the flag to be animated, due to the fact that it is covered and this page doesn't really need the extra bandwidth usage</p>
              <p>The form is a simple form that will go to the "captain" who ever that may be... possibly the program director. I styled the form to be inline with the styling of the site.</p>
              <p>I noticed that the menu does not have a link to the crew page, which might be problematic when I get into making the breadcrumbs more dynamic. However, there is still a way back to the crew page through the breadcrumbs, but it does not seem very intuitive.</p>
              <p>The remaining elements on the page are pretty much the same as they were on other pages.</p>
              <p>This compass point will ultimately go to the <a href="sitemap.html">sitemap</a></p>
